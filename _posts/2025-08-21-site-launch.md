Welcome to the refreshed site. It's now powered by the Minimal Mistakes theme (dark skin) with a streamlined config and an automated GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys on every push to `master`.

Highlights:

- Dark, accessible, mobileâ€‘first design
- Faster builds with cached gems
- Clean permalink structure `/category/title/`
- Copy button on code blocks
- Pagination ready (will populate as posts are added)

Next up: writing! ðŸš€
