Hi, I'm **Alex** — engineer, learner, and builder. This site is a lightweight stream of ideas & notes. I optimize for:

1. Clarity over cleverness
2. Shipping over polishing forever
3. Learning in public

### What I'm focused on

- Crafting maintainable systems with strong boundaries
- Developer experience & automation
- Fast feedback loops / CI reliability

### Principles

<div class="callout">
<strong>Keep surface area small.</strong> Every dependency and feature is a maintenance contract. Be intentional.
</div>

### Uses

Tools rotate, but recently: VS Code, GitHub Copilot, Go, TypeScript/React, Postgres, Redis, Docker, and a lot of plain text & whiteboards.

### Contact

Feel free to reach out on <a href="https://github.com/AlexMollard">GitHub</a> or open an issue / discussion.

This site is intentionally minimal – no trackers, no heavy JS. View the source on GitHub.

Thanks for visiting.
