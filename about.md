Hi, I'm **Alex**.

I enjoy designing and building clean, reliable software systems and occasionally writing about what I learn along the way.

This site is generated with Jekyll (Minimal Mistakes theme, dark skin) and deployed automatically via GitHub Actions.

Feel free to reach out via the links in the footer.
