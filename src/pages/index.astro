    <h2>About</h2>
    <div class="about-grid">
      <p class="section-lead">I'm a game developer at Big Ant Studios focused on tools, networking, memory optimization, and overall game stability. Recent work spans implementing WebSockets and online flows, building leak‑tracking tools, and fixing crashes across systems. Shipped titles include TIEBREAK (ATP/WTA), Cricket 24, AFL 23, Rugby 25, AFL 26, and Rugby League 26.</p>
      <div class="about-body">
        <p>I build internal tools, implement networking (WebSockets, PlayFab + low‑level sockets), optimize memory with leak‑tracking, and tackle crash triage across gameplay, rendering, UI, and platform layers—often self‑leading across teams to unblock and stabilize builds.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Outside the studio I prototype engines/renderers (Vulkan/OpenGL), explore procedural systems, and maintain an audio visualizer—always with an eye on performance and player experience.</p>
